# Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph
This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Visualize Data with a Bar Chart project.

## Objective
Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bgpXyK/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Give it your own personal style. You can use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library.

Dataset provided by freeCodeCamp can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json).

User stories:
* __User Story #1:__ I can see a title element that has a corresponding `id="title"`.
* __User Story #2:__ I can see an x-axis that has a corresponding `id="x-axis"`.
* __User Story #3:__ I can see a y-axis that has a corresponding `id="y-axis"`.
* __User Story #4:__ I can see dots, that each have a class of `dot`, which represent the data being plotted.
* __User Story #5:__ Each dot should have the properties `data-xvalue` and `data-yvalue` containing their corresponding x and y values.
* __User Story #6:__ The `data-xvalue` and `data-yvalue` of each dot should be within the range of the actual data and in the correct data format. For `data-xvalue`, integers (full years) or Date objects are acceptable for test evaluation. For `data-yvalue` (minutes), use Date objects.
* __User Story #7:__ The `data-xvalue` and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the x-axis.
* __User Story #8:__ The `data-yvalue` and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the y-axis.
* __User Story #9:__ I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with `%M:%S` time format.
* __User Story #10:__ I can see multiple tick labels on the x-axis that show the year.
* __User Story #11:__ I can see that the range of the x-axis labels are within the range of the actual x-axis data.
* __User Story #12:__ I can see that the range of the y-axis labels are within the range of the actual y-axis data.
* __User Story #13:__ I can see a legend containing descriptive text that has `id="legend"`.
* __User Story #14:__ I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
* __User Story #15:__ My tooltip should have a `data-year` property that corresponds to the `data-xvalue` of the active area.
